										<h1>Take our survey </h1>
									</header>
									<p> <b>What?</b> This 15-20 minute survey will ask about your practices and experience around research data in diversity scholarship, and what potential resources you might find useful in a toolkit.</p>
									<p> <b>Why?</b> We believe many scholars would benefit from additional support around research data management, and that diversity scholars in particular may already be using practices that would be beneficial to share more widely. This survey is intended to identify gaps in support, and effective practices and resources that already exist. The end goal of this project is a toolkit to support diversity scholars in making confident decisions around their research data.</p>
									<p> <b>Who?</b> We are a research group made up of Library and NCID participants at the University of Michigan, surveying self-identified diversity scholars. </p>
									<p> <b>More! </b> The information (data) collected in this survey may be shared with other researchers or publicly through a repository, but identifying information will be removed before data are shared. If you have concerns about the responses we collect from you or would like to specify information you do not want shared, you will have a chance to indicate this at the end of the survey. This study has been reviewed by the IRB office at the University of Michigan and has received an exemption. There are no direct benefits to participating in this survey. As the focus of this study are activities that normally occur in working with research data, the anticipated risks of participating in this study are minimal. You may discontinue your participation at any time.</p>
